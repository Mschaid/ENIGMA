**A framework for prediciting neural dyanmics from experimental data with deep learning**

Understanding neuromodulatory dynamics and impact on behavior is incomplete despite extensive research. We provide a novel tool-kit to extract bidirectionally predictive behavioral features and neural activity. Through application we aim to understand and extract unanticipated neural correlates, aid in the the discovery of insights into its temporal dynamics and predictive features, and advance knowledge in health and disease.
