**A framework for prediciting neural dyanmics from experimental data with deep learning**

Understanding neuromodulatory dynamics and impact on behavior is incomplete despite extensive research. We provide a novel tool-kit to extract bidirectionally predictive behavioral features and neural activity. Through application we aim to understand and extract unanticipated neural correlates, aid in the the discovery of insights into its temporal dynamics and predictive features, and advance knowledge in health and disease.

## Basic Features
The ENIGMA project provides the following basic features:

### Preprocessing
The preprocessing module provides tools to clean and preprocess raw neural data.

### Data Processing
The data processing module provides tools to process preprocessed data and extract behavioral features.

### Modeling
The modeling module provides tools to train deep learning models on the processed data.

### Inference and visualization
The inference and visualization module provides tools to make predictions on new data and visualize the results.

### Deployment
The deployment module provides tools to deploy the trained models in production environments.
